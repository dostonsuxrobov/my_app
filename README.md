# React Meetups + Super Mario Game

This application was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
It now includes a fully-featured **Super Mario Game** with platforms, enemies, coins, and smooth gameplay! You can find it under **Play Mario** in the navigation bar.

## Game Features

- **Classic Mario gameplay** with jumping, running, and platforming
- **Collect coins** to increase your score (100 points each)
- **Defeat enemies** by jumping on them (200 points each)
- **Multiple platforms** and challenging level design
- **Smooth camera scrolling** that follows Mario
- **High score tracking** to challenge yourself
- **Beautiful graphics** with animated Mario, coins, and enemies
- **Responsive controls** - Use Arrow Keys or WASD to move, Space or Up Arrow to jump

## Play the Game

The game is deployed on GitHub Pages and can be played at:
**https://dostonsuxrobov.github.io/my_app**

To deploy the app to GitHub Pages update the `homepage` field in `package.json` to match your repository URL and run:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

The build output will be pushed to the `gh-pages` branch which can be used with GitHub Pages.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
